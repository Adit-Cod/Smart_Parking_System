" # Smart_Parking_System "

The project aims to create and simulate a simple smart parking System.

The  following Functionalities have been incorporated 

1. Push Button Enabled Entry Exit of Cars
2. LCD interfaced to show Users on space availability
3. Ultrasonic sensor to validate no obstacles in the servo motors path (assumed lever attached)
4. Push data into ThingsSpeak Server every x minutes to have data visualization in a dashboard fashion. 
5. Simulation using Proteus with arduino Code. 
6. Date and time of entry/exit has been captured in a localized array

Play around with the parameters to learn and understand the project better. 

Future Scope Ideas

1. Draw inferences/use data to predict busy times of the day to allow for useful information to the public
2. Allow User to block a parking space using an App; which then communicates with your hardware using wireless COM services

Have more?
